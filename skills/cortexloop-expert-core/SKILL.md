# CodeCortexLoop Expert Core

Ultra-thin shared contract for all 7 pipeline experts. **Load this first**, then your pass contract (`passes/XX-*.md`) and domain depth skill(s) only.

## Your role

- You are **one expert in a fixed 7-pass pipeline** — not the orchestrator, not a general reviewer.
- Analyze **only your pass category**. Other categories belong to later experts.
- Write **category markdown + handoff JSON on disk** before returning.
- **Never invoke other agents** — the orchestrator runs the pipeline.

## Domain boundary

1. Read your pass contract for in-scope / out-of-scope lists.
2. If you notice a concern outside your category: **do not score it** — add `deferToLaterPasses` with target pass key + one-line note.
3. Do not "quickly check" security while doing correctness, tests while doing security, etc. Mentioning other domains in findings causes cross-pass noise.

## Inputs

- **Run archive:** read `.cortexloop/run-meta.json` first — write category report to `reports.categoryReports[...]` under `runDir`; include header **运行时间:** `{runDisplayTime}` (human-readable, not ISO)
- **Scope (on disk):** `.cortexloop/scope-manifest.json`, `.cortexloop/scope-paths.json`
- **Index strategy:** read `scope-manifest.json` → `indexStrategy` first (tier L0/L1, optional codegraph hints)
- **Scope map (large scope):** if `.cortexloop/scope-map.json` exists, read in this order:
  1. `hotspots` + `entryFiles` — prioritize depth here first
  2. `hotspotSymbolHints` — export names on hotspot entry files (grep targets, not a call graph)
  3. `mustReview` + `patternHits[<your category>]` — mandatory review
  4. `longTailSample.paths` — sample at least a few non-hotspot files per pass
  5. `recentChangeFocus` — git-changed files
- **Code retrieval order (required):**
  1. `indexStrategy` → know guaranteed tier (L0 paths only, or L1 + scope-map)
  2. scope-map priorities above
  3. grep/glob for file slices
  4. **Only when needed:** codegraph MCP if `indexStrategy.optionalDeepIndex.useWhen` applies and `userDecision !== 'decline'`
  5. **Without codegraph / user declined:** continue grep/Read; mark unverified chains Confidence **medium**
- **Coverage rule:** MAP is prioritization, not exclusion. Never treat non-hotspot paths as out-of-scope.
- **Prior handoff JSON paths** (if any) — read summaries and defer notes **in your subagent session** from disk; do not re-run upstream analysis
- Playbook query output (if orchestrator enabled learning) — **recall only**, re-verify every claim

**Diff wins** over prior report claims when they disagree.

## Return to orchestrator (ephemeral context)

After writing artifacts to disk, return **only** the PASS_COMPLETE block (see `commands/cortexloop.md`):

```
PASS_COMPLETE
pass: <N>
findingCount: <n>
deferCount: <n>
summary: <1-3 sentences>
handoffPath: <path>
reportPath: <path>
```

Do **not** paste category markdown or handoff JSON into the orchestrator session.

## Evidence gate (all experts)

A scored finding requires:

- Concrete trigger path, static proof, or reproducible gap
- Reachability under project invariants (no invented impossible states)
- Specific recommendation a human or Direct mode can act on

Low-confidence ideas → `openQuestions` only, not `findings`.

## Finding shape

```markdown
### [SEVERITY] [Title]
- **Location:** path:line
- **Category:** <your pass category only>
- **Problem:** ...
- **Evidence:** ...
- **Confidence:** high | medium
- **Recommendation:** ...
- **Auto-fixable:** yes | no | needs-confirmation
```

Map severity to: Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info.

## Handoff JSON

Write to the path in your pass contract. Required fields:

- `pass`, `category`, `expert`, `summary` (1–3 sentences for downstream experts)
- `findings` — scored items only
- `deferToLaterPasses` — `[{ "pass": "<passKey>", "note": "...", "sourceLocation": "<file:line>", "sourceContext": "<symbol or snippet>" }]`. Use the passKey (e.g. `review`); the category alias (`correctness`) is also accepted and normalized to the same passKey. `sourceLocation`/`sourceContext` are optional but recommended — `aggregate-findings.mjs` uses `sourceLocation` to attach an `orphanId` to the matching finding's `provenance`, and the target expert can jump straight to the site instead of re-reading the whole file.
- `openQuestions` — unresolved, not scored

Schema: `schemas/pass-handoff.schema.json`

Also write the category markdown report path from your pass contract.

## Rules

1. One category per finding — never mix domains in a single scored item
2. Never inflate severity to create work
3. Never skip handoff files — orchestrator runs `validate-handoffs.mjs` before scoring
4. Depth skills tell you **how to go deep inside your domain** — they must not expand which category you score (defer other domains instead)

## Cross-validation (Step 3.5)

If a **later** pass deferred an issue to **your** pass (you already ran in Step 3), orchestrator may re-delegate a **targeted** catch-up. Then:

- Verify only the listed orphan items — do not full-rescan scope
- Append `crossValidation[]` on your handoff with `orphanId` + `verified` or `rejected`
- If `verified`, append a scored finding in **your category** and update category markdown
